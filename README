DroidCouch is a minimal Android library for using CouchDB, licensed under the MIT license.

Our intention is to make a small Java library well suited for Android mobile development. 

DroidCouch was inpired by Divan (http://github.com/foretagsplatsen/Divan), a C# library with a more or less complete CouchDB API. DroidCouch is currently developed in-house at MSC Konsult AB.

To get started, read the file INSTALL.
